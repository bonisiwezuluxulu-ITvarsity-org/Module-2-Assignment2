                       <p>Plot <br>
                        In the opening scenes, in Tallinn, an old man with a white beard and his young niece are looking at a red bicycle as a possible Christmas gift. The girl says she doesn't want red but wants to wait and get a blue bicycle instead. The old man says that nothing is certain in life and Christmas is a long time away. Maybe she will get it, and maybe she won't.
The bicycle shopkeeper makes a phone call. A white van stops in front of a Danish train station where a blue bicycle is chained to a post. Two hooded men get out, cut the chain, put the bicycle into the van, and drive away.
Markus is a soldier in Afghanistan. He calls his wife, Emma, who says that their daughter Mathilde's bicycle was stolen at the train station and now the family car won't start.
