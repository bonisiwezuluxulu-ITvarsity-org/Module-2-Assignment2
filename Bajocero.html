                       <p>Plot <br>
                        The title sequence shows a man in the dark woods torturing another man for information, and burying him alive when he claims not to know the location of the missing body.

                        Having just changed the punctured tire of his car, police officer Martin is detailed to drive a prisoner transport at night. On a lonely road, their truck is stopped by a spike strip. As Montesino, the escorting police officer, leaves the armored truck to assess the situation, he finds their pilot vehicle off the roadside and the two officers inside shot dead. Subsequently he is shot by a sniper from the dark woods, and later succumbs to his injuries. Martin, the policeman who was driving, survives and enters the prisoners' compartment, where he is overpowered by the convicts. The outside assailant, Miguel, enters the truck's cabin and indicates through the intercom that he is after one prisoner in particular. Being unable to open the secured prisoners' compartment, he drives the truck into a frozen lake.
                        
                        Eventually it comes to a showdown in an abandoned village by the lakeside where Miguel reveals that he lost his daughter to a rape/murder, and that her body had never been found. With police support arriving, Martin at the last minute decides to depart from his law-abiding convictions and tortures Nano to extract the location of the disposed body of Miguel's daughter.
