                            <h3>KFC</h3>
                            KFC (abbr. for Kentucky Fried Chicken) is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky that specializes in fried chicken. It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019.[5] The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and WingStreet chains.
                            KFC first entered the South African market in 1971.[8] The company was forced to divest its 60 company owned outlets and trademarks to a South African holding company called Devco in 1987 after the US Congress passed a law forbidding American companies from owning South African assets.
                            As of 2021, there are 960 KFC outlets in South Africa, and the fast food chain has more outlets in the country than any other fast food brand.[1][2][3] Ten percent of outlets are company owned, and 90 percent are franchise owned.
